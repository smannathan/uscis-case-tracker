**Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date:** November 1, 2024

Thank you for choosing USCIS Case Tracker (the "App"). We are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information that we do not collect, how your data is handled locally on your device, and your responsibilities in protecting your personal information while using the App.

**1. Information We Do Not Collect**

The USCIS Case Tracker App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on our servers. All case-related information that you enter into the App remains stored locally on your device, with no data transmitted to us or any external parties. We do not retain or have access to any personal information about your USCIS case.

**2. Data Stored Locally on Your Device**

All information related to your USCIS case status is stored directly on your device. This information, including any updates you input, is maintained locally to enable you to track the progress of your case through the App. As the information is stored on your device alone, you have complete control over its security and are solely responsible for protecting this data against unauthorized access.

**3. Third-Party Services**

The App utilizes the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Case Status API to provide you with real-time updates on your case. While the App interacts with this API, no information is shared with us, and we do not store or process your data. The accuracy, reliability, and security of the USCIS API service fall under the responsibility of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Your use of the USCIS API via the App is at your discretion and risk.

**4. Device Security Responsibilities**

As all data is stored locally, you are responsible for securing your device against unauthorized access. We recommend using a strong password, biometric protection, and any other security features your device offers. Please be aware that the security and confidentiality of your USCIS case information are solely within your control and depend on the precautions you implement to protect your device.

**5. No Analytics or Tracking**

The USCIS Case Tracker App does not engage in analytics, tracking, or monitoring of user interactions. We do not collect any data about your usage, device details, or App interactions. This means that all activities you perform within the App remain private to you.

**6. Children's Privacy**

The USCIS Case Tracker App is not intended for individuals under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect, store, or process any data from users under the age of 13. If we become aware that information from a child under 13 has been entered into the App, we will assist the user in ensuring that it is promptly deleted.

**7. Updates to This Privacy Policy**

We may periodically update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, regulatory, or operational reasons. When updates are made, the “Effective Date” at the top of this document will be revised. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to remain informed of any changes and to stay aware of our data handling practices.
